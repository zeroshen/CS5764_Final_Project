                The play store applications data has
                enormous potential to drive application-making businesses and companies to success.
                The goal of this analysis is to provide insights to android application developers about the
                trends in the android market and help them in creating more influential or successful applications based
                on various factors like rating, reviews, number of installs, etc. Actionable insights
                can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the android market!</p>

                applications on the playstore.
                This is done by measuring the number of successful and unsuccessful applications in each category (free/
                paid).
                For measuring the success of an application, a threshold of 1,000,000 downloads has been selected.
                The first insight that this visualization provides is that there is a higher chance of success for free
                applications than there is for paid applications. Hovering over each color in the pie chart
                provides further information about the number of applications. A tooltip has been employed for the
                same. </p>

                the most successful paid applications costed. Success was measured by the number of installs, which in
                our case was above 1,000,000. One application costed under 3.49$ while two others costed between 3.49$
                and 6.99$. It was much more probable for an application to be successful if it was free of cost as
                opposed to paid.</p>

                growth of applications in specific categories and having specific content ratings with time. The pie
                charts also show what portion of the market has been captured by specific application categories and
                content ratings. The area chart shows us that there is a huge spike in the number of applications
                towards the end of 2018. The ‘family’ genre and ‘everyone’ content rating has had the most share of the
                market at any given point telling us that this is the sweet spot developers should focus on. </p>

                successful applications. We make them aware of the factors behind successful applications, and they
                can then incorporate them into their applications. We also explore why certain applications fail, the
                signs of which can be used by developers as indicators that they are heading in the wrong direction. A
                variety of genres are analyzed and the reason behind their success or failure is explored. Sentiments
                from reviews are also used in our visualization to give developers a better idea of what customers want
                and what to focus on while building the applications.
